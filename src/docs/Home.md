# {{frontmatter.title}}

Hi,I'm JohnsonXIn,a student who loves front-end and open source.

&nbsp;

When I come across something interesting or cool, I will use my curiosity to study it.

At the same time,I am interested in beautiful things and design.
Anyway,you can see why I love front-end and open source.

Outside of programming,I love photography and traveling, and if you happen to live in the same city as me (currently in Tianjin), maybe we could hang out, take some photos or write code together. I also like to watch movies,I dabbled in a lot of domestic foreign movies.Here I highly recommend you to watch Stephen Chow's movies.

&nbsp;

If you enjoy my works, consider sponsoring me on[<span class="i-mdi-light:flash" />爱发电](https://afdian.net/a/studtwork) or [<span class="i-ic:baseline-wechat" />wechat](http://cdn.reday.asia/images/202308081720863.jpg) or [<span class="i-ant-design:alipay-outlined" />Alipay](http://cdn.reday.asia/images/202308081719043.jpg) to keep them sustainable.
